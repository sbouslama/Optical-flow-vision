# Demystifying the Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow Algorithm with Vivado HLS
The Lucas-Kanade (LK) algorithm for dense optical flow estimation is a widely known and
adopted technique for object detection and tracking in image processing applications. This
algorithm is computationally intensive and its implementation in an FPGA is challenging from
both a design and a performance perspective. This application note describes how to
implement the LK algorithm with the Xilinx Vivado® High-level Synthesis (HLS) tool to achieve
real-time performance in the Zynq®-7000 All Programmable (AP) SoC without image
quality degradation
